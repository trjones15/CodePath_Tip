## Notes

My number one challenge that I encountered while making this app was that I didn't know enough php. My strategy to conquer this was to study up on php and php with mySql in order to accomplish this. Then, the only other major challenge I encountered was knocking the cobwebs off of my html and css skills, which wasn't too hard.
